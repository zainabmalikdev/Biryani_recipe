        <h1>Beef Biryani Recipe</h1>
            <p>1. Wash the rice and soak it in water for 30 minutes.
            2. Heat oil in a large pan. Fry onions until golden brown. Remove half for garnishing later.
            3. Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for 1 minute.
            4. Add beef pieces, salt, turmeric, red chili powder, and biryani masala. Cook until the beef starts to brown (about 10-15 minutes).
            5. Add yogurt, chopped tomatoes, green chilies, and half of the chopped coriander & mint. Cover and cook on low heat until beef is tender (around 30-40 minutes, depending on beef cut).
            l6. In another pot, boil 4 cups of water. Add soaked rice and cook until 70% done. Drain the water.
            7. Layer the partially cooked rice over the beef. Sprinkle fried onions, garam masala, and remaining coriander & mint.
            8. Drizzle ghee on top. Cover tightly and cook on very low heat for 20 minutes (dum cooking).
            9. Serve hot with raita, salad, or a boiled egg on top.
